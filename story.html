      The Story in the Book

    Chapter 1
  </h2>
  <p>
    <a href="file:///Users/hermanchenwi/betamore/project/index.html">Molly</a> had been staring out of her window for about
    an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies
    of Nature, New Scientist, and all the other scientific
    journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed
    copy of On The Road. It had been Molly's favourite book
    since college, and the longer she spent in these four walls
    the more she felt she needed to be free.

    She had spent the last ten years in this room,
    sitting under a poster with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> quote
    proclaiming that Work is the refuge of people who
    have nothing better to do. Although many considered
    her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the
    llama DNA, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly
    did think she had something better to do.

  Text is easier to understand when it is split up
  into units of text. For example, a book may have
  chapters. Chapters can have subheadings. Under
  each heading there will be one or more paragraphs.
